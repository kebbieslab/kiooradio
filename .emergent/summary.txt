The AI engineer successfully built out significant features for the Kioo Radio application. Initially, core CRM functionalities, CSV import, and module management (Visitors, Donations, Projects) were established and integrated. A major development was the AI-Powered Program Assistant (), leveraging OpenAI LLMs for content analysis, later made public. The CRM was then enhanced with a Merge & SSO Status dashboard and the full integration of module components. The latest work focused on two main areas: first, enhancing CRM Projects with receipt/multimedia uploads, AI analysis, and multi-format report generation, including Dropbox integration. This was followed by implementing a comprehensive User Management system within the CRM Settings, covering user creation, roles, permissions, and email notifications. Finally, minor program schedule updates were initiated. The most immediate pending tasks relate to implementing weather predictions on the Dashboard and updating a specific program schedule.
