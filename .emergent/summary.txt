The AI engineer's work involved two primary feature sets: an Interactive Weekly Programming Clocks page and a comprehensive Kioo Dashboard: GMT + Farmer Messages. The clocks page saw iterative development, from an initial complex design to a simplified donut chart, then re-enhanced with a 24-hour interactive clock and real-time data. The dashboard transitioned from an authenticated admin tool to a public-facing, farmer-focused weather forecast.

This dashboard underwent extensive design iterations, including branding alignment, content removal (wind, 3-day forecast), temperature unit conversion, country-specific flag-themed styling, and the implementation of descriptive weather conditions inspired by VOX Radio. Finally, it was refactored into a tabbed interface for current and forecast views, with the forecast tab also receiving a design overhaul. The most recent focus has shifted to refining the Clocks page's program schedule. The engineer adeptly handled deployment issues and adapted to user pivots, particularly from a full podcast system to a Program Samples page.

<product_requirements>
The Kioo Radio platform provides mobile-first, multilingual (EN/FR) content. Recent feature developments include:
1.  **Interactive Weekly Programming Clocks ()**: Displays program schedules locked to Liberia time (GMT/UTC+0), featuring a 24-hour interactive clock, language filters, and program distribution visualization. Export functionality was implemented.
2.  **Kioo Dashboard: GMT + Farmer Messages ()**: Initially an authenticated admin dashboard, it evolved into a public-facing, farmer-focused weather page. It now presents weather cards for specific locations (Foya, Koindu, Guéckédou, Kissidougou) with live GMT timestamps, current conditions (temperature in Fahrenheit, humidity, rain probability, rain/hour), descriptive weather terms (Overcast, Partly Cloudy), and a 2-day forecast. The design is mobile-first, low-bandwidth, branded with Kioo colors, and uses flag-themed styling for country cards. It supports bilingual display and features a tabbed interface for Current Weather and Forecast.
3.  **Program Samples Page ()**: Replaced a full podcast system. This page showcases previews of radio content with a nice layout, smaller thumbnail images, native HTML5 audio players (preload=none), language filters, and share functionality. It's designed for low internet bandwidth and mobile-first.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: FastAPI (Python), React (JavaScript), MongoDB.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive, mobile-first design.
-   **Internationalization**: Custom  utility, ,  for bilingual support.
-   **Time Management**:  for fixed GMT/UTC+0 timestamps.
-   **Data Visualization**: SVG for clocks, basic HTML5 audio for program samples.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

-   : The core FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance**: Defines API endpoints, data models, and business logic.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed  to . Added  endpoint for weather data. Initially added and then removed comprehensive podcast API endpoints and models (Series, Episodes, RSS feed, Bulk Import). Modified hardcoded URLs for deployment.
-   : Stores static configuration for clocks page.
    -   **Importance**: Provides language definitions and program schedule templates.
-   : React component for the Interactive Programming Clocks page.
    -   **Importance**: Renders the program schedule visualization.
    -   **Changes**: Iteratively enhanced with interactive 24-hour clock, language filters, and dynamic program data. Most recently, the user requested adding monthly/yearly airtime analytics, making daily clocks interactive, and moving a specific Kissi TTB program.
-   : React component for the Program Samples page.
    -   **Importance**: Replaced a full podcast implementation with a simpler page to showcase audio program samples.
    -   **Changes**: Initially created for a full podcast system, then refactored to display program samples with thumbnails, native audio players (preload=none), language filters, and share functionality. Updated with real program data and selected images.
-    (NEW): React component for the dedicated Farmer Weather Dashboard.
    -   **Importance**: Provides a public-facing, farmer-focused weather forecast page.
    -   **Changes**: Created by moving content from . Implemented branding, Fahrenheit conversion, flag-themed colors, removed wind/3-day forecast, added weather icons, descriptive weather conditions (Overcast, Partly Cloudy), and a tabbed interface for Current Weather and Forecast.
-   : Original admin dashboard.
    -   **Importance**: Previously hosted the farmer weather features behind authentication.
    -   **Changes**: The farmer weather functionality was initially moved *into* this component and had its authentication removed, but later it was moved *out* to , making this file effectively revert to its original 'Presenters Dashboard' content.
-   : Main React application file.
    -   **Importance**: Defines application routes.
    -   **Changes**: Added routing for ,  (Program Samples), and .
-   : Application header component.
    -   **Importance**: Contains navigation elements.
    -   **Changes**: Added Clocks, Program Samples, and Weather Dashboard links under the Programs dropdown.
-   , : Translation files.
    -   **Importance**: Store English and French translations.
    -   **Changes**: Added numerous keys for the Clocks page, Dashboard/Weather Dashboard (GMT labels, farmer messages, weather metrics, condition descriptions), and Program Samples.
-   : Geolocation utility.
    -   **Importance**: Potentially used for geo-targeted content.
    -   **Changes**: Hardcoded geolocation API URL made configurable via  for deployment.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of the geo-targeted language detection system.
-   Optimize photos for web use (general optimization pending).
-   Add clocks for the month and year indicating air time analytics with impact on the Clocks page.
-   Make the daily clocks interactive on the Clocks page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was primarily working on the Kioo Dashboard: GMT + Farmer Messages, now located at . This page has undergone extensive refinement to meet user requirements for a mobile-first, low-bandwidth, and visually consistent experience.

The dashboard currently features:
-   **Tabbed Interface**: Separates Current Weather and Forecast into distinct tabs.
-   **Compact Current Weather Cards**: Displays essential weather information (temperature in Fahrenheit, descriptive condition like Overcast or Partly Cloudy, humidity, rain probability, rain per hour with icons) for Foya, Koindu, Guéckédou, and Kissidougou. These cards are designed to fit in one view without scrolling, incorporating flag-themed colors for each country.
-   **Refined Forecast Tab**: Provides a 2-day forecast with clear labels, high/low temperatures, and weather icons, consistent with a professional dashboard style.
-   **Consistent Branding**: Aligns with Kioo Radio's color scheme and typography.
-   **Removed Features**: Wind data and extended 3-day predictions were removed to streamline the view.
-   **GMT Time**: All timestamps and clocks use GMT (UTC+0).
-   **Bilingual Support**: English and French translations are implemented.

The user then pivoted back to the  page, requesting to modify a specific program's schedule. The AI engineer's last action was to read the content of  to address the request of moving the second Kissi TTB program.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Move the second Kissi TTB program from 12:00-12:30 to 20:00-20:30 on the  page.
