<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully progressed the Kioo Radio application by integrating significant new features. The initial phase involved completing user profile updates on the  page. Subsequently, two major functional modules were fully implemented: a comprehensive internal CRM system at  with backend endpoints for contact management and a statistics dashboard, and a robust multilingual (EN/FR) internationalization system across the frontend using a new  utility and . An Admin Dashboard at  was also built, providing key metrics with custom SVG charts. The current work, initiated by user-provided CSV files, is focused on developing a data source connection system for importing external data into the CRM. This trajectory demonstrates a clear progression from completing initial fixes to building complex, production-ready features.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented the Projects list + detail functionality. This included creating backend API endpoints for project CRUD operations, listing, and exporting, as well as developing two new frontend React pages:  for the project list and  for individual project details. The projects system integrates with the existing authentication, i18n for labels, and provides features like adding new projects via a modal form, filtering projects by status, country, and manager, and exporting the list to CSV/XLSX. A screenshot verification confirmed the successful loading and functionality of the  page, displaying project lists, an add project modal with comprehensive fields, and filters, all with proper styling and Kioo branding.
